# PyStat
A Python3-based library for simple maths stats.

## Use
Run the PyStat.py file located at the root of the project or import the pystat module in your project by adding it to the project's root.
Then you have to include it in your code with ```from pystat import * ``` ( '*' can be replaced with the desired functions even if importing all the module is recommended to avoid errors).
